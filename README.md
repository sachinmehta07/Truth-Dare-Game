## **Functionality & Concepts used**

The Truth And Dare Game app boasts a straightforward and engaging design, making it easy for users to add, explore, and enjoy customized truth and dare challenges. The app incorporates various Android concepts to deliver a seamless user experience:

- `Constraint Layout` : All of the activities in the app uses a flexible <b>Constraint Layout</b>, which is easy to handle for different screen sizes.
- `Recyclerview` :  To present the list of different notes and important notes we used the efficient <b>Recyclerview</b>. 
- `Shared-Preferences:` : Utilized SharedPreferences to store user data, enabling users to access their added truth or dare challenges whenever the app is launched.
- `ArrayList` : Implemented ArrayList to manage and store data related to truth and dare challenges, facilitating smooth organization and retrieval.
- `Navigation Component` : We are also using the <b>Navigation component</b> to switch pages/destination within the app.
- `Dialog` : A custom dialog is used to add truth or dare challenges, providing users with a personalized and user-friendly experience.
- `Rotation class:`  The app incorporates a rotation class in Android to enable interactive object rotation, enhancing the overall user interface.

## **Future Scope**

- `Firebase Integration` : Implement Firebase for secure authentication, allowing users to have personalized profiles, track their game history, and engage in a broader community.

- `Login and Registration` : Introduce a user login and registration system for a more personalized experience. Users can save their preferences, track their achievements,
